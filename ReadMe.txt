make up your Cold Fusion custom tag DLL.

	(ProcessTagRequest). This is the function you should modify in
	order to implement your custom tag's behavior.

execute.def
    This file contains information about the DLL that must be
    provided to run with Microsoft Windows.  It defines parameters
    such as the name and description of the DLL.  It also exports
	functions from the DLL (note that all tag request functions must
	be listed in the EXPORTS section of this file).

	This is the main header file for the DLL.  It declares the
	CExecuteApp class.

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named execute.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
